Minimal HTML & CSS Components Collection

This repository contains 6 minimal dummy components that I built as part of a Udemy Web Development Course. These components were created using basic HTML and CSS with the goal of understanding foundational web development concepts. While the components are simple, they serve as building blocks for more complex, dynamic features in future projects.

Components Overview
Accordion:
A collapsible content section, great for hiding additional information.
Pure HTML structure with CSS for basic styling.
Carousel:
A minimal image/content slider layout, without interactive functionality.
Created using basic HTML and CSS for layout practice.
Table:
A simple, styled table layout for displaying data.
Does not include dynamic sorting or interactivity.
Pagination:
A basic pagination layout, serving as a placeholder for future functionality.
Hero Section:
A minimal full-width section, typically used to feature a primary message or call to action.
Demo App Layout:
A basic app structure layout, with headers, footers, and content sections.
Provides a foundational structure for future web apps.
Purpose
These components are intentionally minimal and designed to demonstrate core HTML and CSS skills. They do not include any advanced functionality like JavaScript interactions but are useful for practicing layout and responsive design.
